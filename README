Yocto EHCI-Debug Layer for USB Device/OTG Targets
======================================================

This layer adds the ability to use any linux board that can act as a USB device (including OTG)
as a simple EHCI debug controller using the Linux USB Gadget EHCI Debug Port driver.

More information, including a simple how-to, to follow.


Adding the echi-debug layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the echi-debug layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the echi-debug layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-echi-debug \
    "
